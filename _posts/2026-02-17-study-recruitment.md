Recruiting for study partipants:

How well do owners estimate obesity and BCS in horses? 
======

Are you a horse owner, and willing to help us with our research?

Horse body condition, whether lean, moderate, or overweight, can affect a horse’s overall health and care requirements. Obesity, in particular, is a growing problem in modern horses with significant health and care implications. We invite you to complete a survey to help us identify how well horse owners recognise obesity and how accurately they body condition score horses. 

You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this survey. The survey is open to horse owners in any country. Your participation should take about 15-20 minutes and is completely voluntary. 

If you are interested in participating, please click [here](https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/edinburgh/how-well-do-owners-estimate-obesity-and-bcs-in-their-horses-as-) to launch the survey.

Thank you for your time!
