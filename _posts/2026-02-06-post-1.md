Assessment of Factors Affecting Body Condition Score in Young Warmblood Horses
======

Are you the registered owner of one or more young warmblood horses born in 2020, 2021 or 2022, and would you be willing to fill out a short survey?

Horse body condition, whether lean, moderate, or overweight, can affect a horse’s overall health and care requirements. Obesity, in particular, is a growing problem in modern horses with significant health and care implications. We invite you to complete a survey to understand factors such as activity, nutrition, and genetics influencing body condition in young horses, with the option to share images of your horse. 

You must be at least 18 years old, and be the registered owner of the horse to participate in this survey. The survey is open to horse owners in any country. Your participation should take about 15 minutes and is completely voluntary. 

If you are interested in participating, please click [here](https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/edinburgh/assessment-of-factors-affecting-body-condition-score-in-young-3) to launch the survey.

Thank you for your time!
