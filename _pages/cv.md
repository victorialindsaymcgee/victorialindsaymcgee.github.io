Personal
======

* I have been a keen horse rider since I was a child, competing in eventing and affiliated dressage as well as taking part in common ridings. In 2014-15 I stabled my horse at a professional event rider’s yard where I would occasionally assist with handling and exercising fit 4* event horses.
* I am a qualified rugby referee, refereeing age grade and adult 15s and 7s in the Scottish Borders for the Borders Rugby Referees Society, and assistant refereeing at national amateur fixtures as a member of the Scottish Rugby National Assistant Referees Panel. Refereeing at this level requires coaching skills and the ability to manage people and make decisions in a fast-paced and high adrenaline situation. I also act as the Secretary for the Borders Rugby Referees Society and sit as a BRRS Representative on the Scottish Rugby Referees Association committee. In 2025 I was awarded the National Community Match Official of the Season Award by Scottish Rugby.
