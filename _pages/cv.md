Personal
======

* I have been a keen horse rider since I was a child, competing in eventing and affiliated dressage as well as taking part in common ridings. In 2014-15 I stabled my horse at a professional event rider’s yard where I would occasionally assist with handling and exercising fit 4* event horses.
* I am a qualified rugby referee, refereeing age grade and adult 15s and 7s in the Scottish Borders for the Borders Rugby Referees Society, and assistant refereeing at national league amateur fixtures. Refereeing at this level requires coaching skills and the ability to manage people and make decisions in a fast-paced and high adrenaline situation. I also act as the Secretary for the Borders Rugby Referees Society. In 2025 I was awarded the National Community Match Official of the Season Award by Scottish Rugby.
