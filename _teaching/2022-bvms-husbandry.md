I conduct practical horse husbandry teaching on the BVM&S programme as part of the Animal Life & Food Safety course that spans first and second year on the five year programme and first year on the graduate entry programme. I teach basic horse handling, some basics of nutrition, passporting and aging by teeth. I also conduct examinations.
