I am the Course Organiser for the [Equine Exercise Physiology](https://vet.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/taught-programmes/msc-equine-science/professional-development#exercise-physio) 20 credit postgraduate taught online course on the [MSc in Equine Science](https://vet.ed.ac.uk/education/postgraduate/taught/msc-equine-science) programme.

I also mark assessments for this course, and teach content on muscle physiology and genetics of performance.
